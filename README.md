# python-bs4

In the bs4_challenge folder there are a series of python programs. Your task is to read through the code and included comments
and make the amzn-multi-page.py program work.  This will involve looking through the code in the other programs to figure out
how each piece of data is being retrieved.  You will also need to use the inpsect function in your browser to determine which
part of the HTML code has the information you are looking for (ie. Price, Title, Rating etc.)

# PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS

1.  amzn-single-item.py - simple program that scrapes title and price from an amazon product page
2.  negg-soup-1pg.py - simple program that scrapes title and price from all items on a newegg.ca search result page
3.  amzn-multi-page.py - program for you to fix, this one will search through multiple results pages from an amazon search
    and lists title, price, rating and more!

# Things you could try...
 - Chnage the URL to a different search result
 - Change the URL to a different site altogether, ie. try the amazon program on eBay or etsy.  Look throught the HTML
   on the other site you try, can you make it work?

# Bonus Marks are available for...
Any program that goes above and beyond the requirements listed above.
This could include, but is not limited to:
 - Loading data into a CSV File, which could then be used in excel 
   or in python for further processing
 - Graphing the data
